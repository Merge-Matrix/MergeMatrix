## Introduction

MergeMatrix is an open-source alternative to JetBrains Space, built to support developers and companies that need a powerful yet flexible collaboration platform for code, commits, merge requests, tasks, and project management. After JetBrains discontinued Space, we recognized the need to continue supporting this vital aspect of software development, especially for small and medium-sized businesses that rely on these tools for seamless team collaboration and productivity.

MergeMatrix is designed as a monorepo to simplify sharing types between frontend and backend and is modularly organized into multiple packages for maintainability and clear component overview.

### Key Features:

- **Open Source.** Free from limitations, vendor lock-in, and hidden paywalls.
- **API-first Architecture.** Built for extensibility and easy integration.
- **REST API Support.** A robust REST API for all functionalities.
- **SQL Database.** Reliable, performant data storage.
- **On-Premises or Cloud Deployment.** Run it locally, host on-premises, or use the _(upcoming)_ cloud-hosted version.
- **Fully Extensible.** A flexible base for customization and white-labeling.
- **Modern Dashboard.** User-friendly interface with essential data at a glance.

## 🦖 Motivation

With the discontinuation of JetBrains Space, we saw an opportunity to create an open-source alternative that could maintain the high standards Space set for project management and code collaboration. Space was an outstanding platform, enabling companies to manage their development workflows efficiently. We aim to carry forward this functionality and reliability, recognizing that for many businesses, project management and code services are the backbone of daily operations. MergeMatrix is committed to providing a seamless, powerful, and cost-effective solution that upholds these standards.
